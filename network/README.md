# MapBiomas Fire Network
Developed by [Amazon Environmental Research Institute - IPAM](https://ipam.org.br/pt/)

## About
This repository contains scripts for mapping burned areas in South American countries as part of the MapBiomas Fire Network initiative. 
The methodology is designed to be replicable across different regions of the continent, using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithm for model training and classification.

## Methodology Overview
The methodology involves several key steps from data preparation to model training and classification, which can be adapted to various regions within South American countries:

## Quick Start: Using Google Colab for Burned Area Classification
To get started quickly, you can use Google Colab to clone this repository, run the scripts, and generate burned area classifications. Follow the steps below:

1. Open the [MapBiomas Fire Landsat Burned Area Classification Notebook](https://github.com/mapbiomas/brazil-fire/blob/main/network/toolkit_mapbiomas_fire_landsat_burned_area_classification.ipynb) on Google Colab.
2. Clone this repository by running the following command in the notebook:
    ```bash
    !git clone https://github.com/mapbiomas/brazil-fire.git
    ```
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the classification for your desired region.

This notebook allows users to run the classification process without needing a local setup, making it easier to test and adapt the scripts.

### 1. **Pre-Processing**
#### Step 01: Export Annual Landsat Mosaics
- Use Google Earth Engine (GEE) to generate annual Landsat mosaics for the region of interest.
- Export these mosaics to Google Cloud Storage for further processing.

#### Step 02: Export Training Samples
- Collect and export training samples, distinguishing between fire and non-fire areas for each specific region of the country.
- Ensure that the samples cover a diverse range of ecosystems within the country's boundaries to improve model accuracy.

### 2. **Classification**
#### Step 03: Train the Model
- Train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model using the collected training samples for the specified region.

#### Step 04: Classify Burned Areas
- Apply the trained model to classify burned areas for the respective region oof the country.
- Validate the results using Landat mosaics to ensure accuracy.

## Repository Structure
- **Scripts**: Contains all the code and algorithms used for mapping burned areas, including model training and classification scripts tailored to different regions and countries.
- **Adapt the Input Data**: Modify the Landsat mosaic generation script to work with the region of interest in your country.
